AWS CI/CD - CloudFormation
Create a Lambda function that populates DynamoDB records if they do not already exist. Create and deploy the Lambda using CloudFormation. Create a schedule that runs the Lambda once a week (choose a day and time you find appropriate).

The DynamoDB records are stored in s3://<user>-academy-scripts/dynamodb/items/<user>-academy-imdb-global.json and s3://<user>-academy-scripts/dynamodb/items/<user>-academy-imdb-jobs.json.
