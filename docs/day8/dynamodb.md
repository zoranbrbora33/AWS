Task submission
Create <service>.yml files for each service.

Tasks
Automate the deployments of the infrastructure you created as a part of the AWS course. Use aws cloudformation deploy to deploy your stack. Once you successfully ran this command on your local machine, copy-paste the code in your buildspec.yml build phase.

Create a cicd/dynamodb.yml CloudFormation template with the following parameters: - DynamoDBTableGlobalName - DynamoDBTableJobsName

Use the DynamoDB specification from [docs/md/Day 1/DynamoDB_tasks.md](docs/md/Day 1/DynamoDB_tasks.md).

Note: make sure to tag your deployments with Owner: <user>.
