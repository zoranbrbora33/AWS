# AWS IAM

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. With IAM, you can centrally manage permissions that control which AWS resources users can access. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.

## IAM Users
Multiple policies are attached to an IAM user.

## IAM Roles
Multiple policies are attached to an IAM role.

## IAM Policies
Define permission scopes between the IAM role/user and an AWS resource (S3, Lambda, Glue, Secrets Manager, ...).
