This is a repository where I resolved tasks working primarly with Amazon Web Services.

I used software development framework AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit).

Also used software development methodology of CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment).

Used Python, SQL, json, and yaml and a lot of AWS resources:

- dynamodb
- glue
- lambda
- s3
- sns
- sqs
- athena
- redshift
- step function
